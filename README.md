This is a beginning of my very first app in React JS which lets its user log in with Facebook ID. My goals are to connect the app with Mapbox and Firebase for some cool features.

Future goals:
- own database (with Firebase)
- own registration system
- use the Mapbox to show user's markers on a map
- full user's profile page

Done:
- log in page
- Facebook logging in (with FB API)
- full responsive
- peek of user's profile page
- JS navigation bar
